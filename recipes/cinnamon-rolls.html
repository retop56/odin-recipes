    <ul>
      <li>2 cups whole milk, warm to the touch</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>5 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Filling</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup light brown sugar</li>
      <li>12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frosting</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>4 oz cream cheese, softened and cubed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the warm milk, sugar,
        and melted butter. The mixture should be just warm, registering between
        100-110˚F (37-43˚C). If any warmer, allow to cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the milk mixture, stir, and let sit in a
        warm place for about 10 minutes until the yeast has bloomed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 4 cups (500 g) of flour to the milk mixture and stir with a wooden
        spoon until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise in a
        warm place for 1 hour, until nearly doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generously butter 2 9-inch (23 cm) round baking pans and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar, butter, and
        cinnamon. Mix well, then set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the plastic wrap from the dough and add the remaining cup of
        flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir well, then turn out onto a clean
        surface. Leave a bit of flour nearby to use as needed, but try not to
        incorporate too much.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead the dough for at least 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary,
        until the dough just loses its stickiness and does not stick to the
        surface or your hands. The dough should be very smooth and spring back
        when poked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about ½-inch (1 cm) thick.
        Fix the corners with a bench scraper or a spatula to make sure they are
        sharp and even.
      </li>
      <li>Spread the filling evenly over the dough.</li>
      <li>
        Starting from one short end, roll up the dough into a log and pinch the
        seam closed. Place seam-side down. Trim any uneven ends.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using unflavored dental floss, cut the log into evenly pieces, about 1½
        inches (8cm) thick. Place the cinnamon rolls in the prepared pans, 1 in
        the center and about 5 around the sides. Cover with a towel and let rise
        in a warm place for 35-45 minutes, until expanded by about half of their
        original volume. If you’re saving the cinnamon rolls for later, cover
        with plastic wrap and freeze for up 3 months.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).</li>
      <li>Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown.</li>
      <li>
        While the cinnamon rolls are baking, make the frosting: In a medium
        bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, melted butter, milk, and vanilla
        extract until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar and whisk until
        homogenous and runny.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the cinnamon rolls are finished, let cool for about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle the frosting over the cinnamon rolls, using the back of a spoon
        to spread if desired.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
