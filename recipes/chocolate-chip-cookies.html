      <p>
        This recipe will show you how to bake cookies from scratch. If you're up
        to it, let's hop in!
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <div class="list-wrapper">
        <ul>
          <li>8 tablespoons of <b>salted butter</b></li>
          <li>1/2 cup <b>white sugar</b></li>
          <li>1/4 cup packed <b>light brown sugar</b></li>
          <li>1 teaspoon <b>vanilla</b></li>
          <li>1 <b>egg</b></li>
          <li>1 1/2 cups <b>all purpose flour</b></li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon <b>baking soda</b></li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon <b>salt</b></li>
          <li>3/4 cup <b>chocolate chips</b></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <div class="list-wrapper">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40
            seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn't be hot &ndash; but it
            should be almost entirely in liquid form.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the
            sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed
            until just incorporated &ndash; 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the
            egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use
            your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. It should
            form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage
            between "wet" dough and "dry" dough). Add the chocolate chips and
            incorporate with your hands.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies)
            and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies
            look puffy and dry and just barely golden.
            <strong>Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE.</strong>
            This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere,
            but this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. Take them out
            even if they look like they're not done yet (see picture in the
            post). They'll be pale and puffy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay,
            eat four or five but then let the rest of them cool). They will sink
            down and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the
            best in all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept
            in an airtight container. I also like to freeze them.
